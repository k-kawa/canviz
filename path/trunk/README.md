Path
====

Introduction
------------

Path is a JavaScript library for drawing hollow or filled paths to an HTML5 web
browser canvas. It provides classes for drawing points, paths (composed of
straight or curved segments), and shapes based on them, including ellipses,
rectangles and polygons. Paths can be drawn using dashed, dotted or solid lines.
This library was created for use by the [Canviz library][1], but can be used on
its own.

Requirements
------------

Path does not require the use of any external libraries, but does require a web
browser that supports the HTML5 canvas element. Most modern browsers, including
Internet Explorer 9 and later, do. To support IE 8 and earlier, you can use a
compatibility library like [ExplorerCanvas][2] (which uses IE's built-in
[VML][3] capabilities) or [FlashCanvas][4] (which requires the [Adobe Flash
Player plugin][5]). A version of ExplorerCanvas is included in the Path
distribution, and the examples use it.

License
-------

Path is provided under the terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

Portions of this software were taken from or based on code from [Oliver Steele's
path.js and bezier.js libraries][6], which are also under the MIT license.

Dashed and dotted line drawing was implemented based on the algorithms described
by Jeremy Gibbons in his 1995 paper [Dotted and Dashed Lines in Metafont][7].

ExplorerCanvas is distrubuted under the terms of the [Apache License version
2.0][8].
