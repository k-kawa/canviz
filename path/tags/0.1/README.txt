PATH
====


Introduction
------------

Path is a library for drawing hollow or filled paths to a web browser canvas. It
provides methods for dealing with Bezier curves, ellipses and points. Paths can
be drawn using dashed, dotted or solid lines. This library was created for use
by the Canviz library, but can be used on its own.

For more information, please visit the Canviz web site at http://canviz.org/ .

Dashed and dotted line drawing was implemented based on the algorithm described
